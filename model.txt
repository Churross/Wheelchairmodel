 
\\ Cost is a function of CostEscorts, CostMaintenance, CostMaintainers and CostDecrease
\\ we use pareto to minimize the cost, plotting it horizontally
Cost=paretoHor(paretoMin(CostEscorts+CostMaintainers+CostMaintenance+CostDecrease)) ;euro

\\ quality depends on how many disabled people an escort takes, and more means less quality
\\ quality can never be less then zero so we take the max of the quality formula and zero
\\ we use pareto to maximize quality, plotting it vertically
quality=paretoVer(paretoMax(max(0,10-NrDisabled/NrEscorts)))

\\ these functions are the formal relationships established in the report
CostEscorts=Salary*NrEscorts ;euro
CostMaintainers=Salary*NrMaintainers ;euro
CostMaintenance=CostDecrease/2.0  ;euro
TotalDistance=2*DistanceKM*NrDisabled ;km
TotalDistance1Escort=Vescort*TimeBetweenFlights ;km
NrEscorts=TotalDistance/TotalDistance1Escort 
NrMaintainers=NrWheelchairs/WheelchairsPerMaintainer 
NrWheelchairs=NrEscorts 
CostDecrease=CostWheelchairPerHour*TimeBetweenFlights*NrEscorts ;euro 
CostWheelchairPerHour=TotalCostWheelchair/TimeTillDestruction ;euro/hour
Salary=SalaryPerHour*TimeBetweenFlights ;euro

\\ constants and sliders
\\ salary per hour is needed to calculate total salary during a trip
SalaryPerHour=20; Euro/hour 
\\ distance between the gates is defined in meters, yet we need kilometres in the equations
DistanceM=100 
\\ so we make kilometres of them
DistanceKM=DistanceM/1000 ;km
\\ the number of disabled is given for any situation
NrDisabled=10 

\\ speed of the escort
\\ we can make the escorts walk faster, so we want to be able to set this
\\ a slider is used to define speed of the escort, for it's entire range
Vescort=slider(0.0001,0.0001,10.8); km/hour 
\\ time between the flights is something we cannot influence so constant
TimeBetweenFlights=1; hour 
\\ we can influence these variables, so we use sliders to define them
WheelchairsPerMaintainer=slider(0.0001,0.0001,48) 
TotalCostWheelchair=slider(0.0001,0.0001,1000); euro 
TimeTillDestructionPerYear=slider(0.0001,0.0001,10)
TimeTillDestruction=TimeTillDestructionPerYear*8760; hour
